This test case tests what happens when fields at the boundary are
switched on in time in a step-function manner. Physically, under such
circumstance, the boundary values should propagate across the grids
at the speed of light, before becoming constants. No unphysical 
oscillation should be observed when time step size and grid size are
chosen appropriately.
