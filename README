Compilation instructions:
>> cd src
>> make

Note:
To compile the program using MPI (currently work in progress...)
    Set "USE_MPI = 1" in /src/Makefile
To compile the serial program
    Set "USE_MPI = 0" in /src/Makefile
(make clean before trying to switch from serial to parallel versions)    

Run instructions (from src directory):
>> ./EMOOPIC path/to/inputfile.txt
e.g.
>> ./EMOOPIC ../data/unitest/input.txt
For parallel version, recompile (see above) and use mpirun, e.g.
>> mpirun -np 16 ./EMOOPIC ../data/unitest/input_MPI.txt

Unit testing (serial only for now...):
executing make in src directory compiles google test unit tests 
and runs all unit tests automatically.

in src directory, can also use
>> make run_tests
or in test directory,
>> make run_tests
